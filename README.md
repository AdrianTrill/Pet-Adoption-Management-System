# Pet Adoption Management System

## Overview

The **Pet Adoption Management System** is a C++ application designed to manage the process of pet adoptions. It features a comprehensive pet management interface, allowing administrators to add, remove, update, and filter pets. Users can view available pets and add them to their adoption list. The system leverages Qt for a clean, intuitive graphical user interface (GUI), and supports multiple storage formats (CSV, HTML, SQLite) for persistent data handling.

### Key Features

- **Pet Management**: Easily add, remove, update, and filter pets based on attributes such as age and breed.
- **Multiple File Storage Options**: Supports saving pet data in text, CSV, HTML, and SQLite database formats for flexible data management.
- **Adoption List**: Users can create and manage their own list of adopted pets, with export options in CSV or HTML.
- **User and Admin Modes**: The system distinguishes between administrator functionalities (pet management) and user functionalities (pet browsing and adoption).
- **Undo/Redo Functionality**: Provides support for undoing and redoing actions in the admin panel.
- **Data Validation**: Ensures all pet data is valid and properly formatted before adding it to the repository.
- **Statistics Visualization**: Includes graphical features, such as pie charts, to represent statistics (e.g., distribution of pets by age).
- **Cross-Platform**: Built using C++ and Qt, making it compatible across multiple platforms.

## System Components

### **Pet and Adoption List Models**
- The system's core models are the `Pet` and `AdoptionList` classes. Each `Pet` has attributes such as name, breed, age, and a photo link, which are managed in an `AdoptionList` for adoption purposes.
  
### **Repository**
- **TxtRepository**: Manages pet data stored in text files.
- **DataBaseRepository**: Handles pet data stored in a SQLite database.
  
### **Service Layer**
- The `PetService` class implements business logic for interacting with the repository, including adding, removing, and updating pet data, as well as managing the adoption list.

### **GUI Layer**
- Built using the Qt framework, the GUI provides an intuitive interface with separate windows for administrators and users. It supports CRUD operations for pets, file export, and real-time adoption management.

## Features

### **Administrator Mode**
Administrators can:
- **Add new pets** with complete details (name, breed, age, photo link).
- **Update existing pet information**.
- **Remove pets** from the repository.
- **View a list of all pets** with the option to filter by breed or age.
- **Undo/Redo** previous actions using a simple button interface.

### **User Mode**
Users can:
- **Browse available pets** and filter them by breed and age.
- **Adopt pets**, adding them to their personal adoption list.
- **Save the adoption list** in either CSV or HTML format.
- **View adoption statistics** through dynamic visualizations (e.g., pie charts).

### **File Format Support**
- **CSV**: Exports the adoption list for spreadsheet applications.
- **HTML**: Exports the adoption list as a webpage.
- **SQLite**: Stores and manages the pet data in a relational database.

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites

- **Qt**: Install Qt on your system.
- **C++11**: Ensure your compiler supports C++11 or later.
- **SQLite**: Install SQLite if using the database storage option.

## Extending the System

- **Add Features**: You can extend the system with additional functionality such as more advanced filtering options or support for exporting to different file formats.
- **Enhance the Model**: Add more attributes to `Pet` or introduce new entities like `Owner` or `AdoptionRecord` to track more detailed information about each pet.
